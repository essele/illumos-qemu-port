# We need to run ctfconvert on all the .o files in qemu. However, some of these
# .o files contain some snippets that are going to cause ctfconvert to fail. If
# ctfconvert is run with the -i option, it will delete the .o file. This is bad.
# Instead we end up using a temporary file and move over it.
#
# This file gets invoked from inside the x86-64_softmmu directory, hence the
# extra .. in the path below. That's kind of ugly, and I almost apologize.
